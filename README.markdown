# Ceres

**Ceres is a platform for users who want to share their healthy recipes, and for people who want to search for potential recipes that fit nutritional, allergen or dietary requirements.**

**The product will be a web based user interaction platform in which content is derived from crowd submission. It will be a place where recipes and ingredients will be stored, shared and viewed. There will be facilities for users to register, save recipes and comment about their success with recipes in order to maintain the quality. Users will be able to provide certain parameters in order to search for recipes that fit their specific needs eg. dietary or nutritional.**

**The target demographic identified for the proposed software is health enthusiasts and people who enjoy cooking. However, this application will be available to anybody who wishes to use it as it is not contracted for any particular user. Users will need a consistent internet connection and web browser to access the system.**

**Ceres is currently under development by:
  @SirBozwellOx,
