    <div class="panel">
      <p>Ceres is a platform for users who want to share their healthy recipes,
        and for people who want to search for potential recipes that fit nutritional,
        allergen or dietary requirements.</p><br>

      <p>The product will be a web based user interaction platform in which
        content is derived from crowd submission. It will be a place where
        recipes and ingredients will be stored, shared and viewed. There will
        be facilities for users to register, save recipes and comment about
        their success with recipes in order to maintain the quality. Users will
        be able to provide certain parameters in order to search for recipes
        that fit their specific needs eg. dietary or nutritional.</p><br>

      <p>The target demographic identified for the proposed software is health
        enthusiasts and people who enjoy cooking. However, this application will
        be available to anybody who wishes to use it as it is not contracted for
        any particular user. Users will need a consistent internet connection
        and web browser to access the system.</p><br>
